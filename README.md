# Prediction on the Number of Confirmed Cases and Deaths in June 2022 for Indonesia 

## Time series prediction was carried out using the models below:
-	Na√Øve method
-	Exponential smoothing state space model (ETS)
-	Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components (TBATS)
 
TBATS was chosen as the final prediction model based on its MAPE values and the predicted values
